# Amazon & Facebook's Sharp Ratio with Python
___
# Project Overview
Sharpe Ratio compares the expected returns for two investment opportunities and calculates the additional return per unit of risk an investor could obtain by choosing one over the other. This project is about calculating the sharp ration for the stocks of the two tech giants Facebook and Amazon. As benchmark we'll use the S&P 500 that measures the performance of the 500 largest stocks in the US. When we use a stock index instead of the risk-free rate, the result is called the Information Ratio and is used to benchmark the return on active portfolio management because it tells you how much more return for a given unit of risk your portfolio manager earned relative to just putting your money into a low-calculating it for the stocks of the two tech giants Facebook and Amazon.
